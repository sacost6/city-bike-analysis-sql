# city-bike-analysis-sql

## Project Background
You’ve probably seen the blue bikes that are part of Divvy bike sharing system here in Chicago. The Divvy system is a commuting service where users pay a yearly fee ($75?) to use the bikes for free as long as rides are less than 30 minutes in duration. Longer rides incur a surcharge. It’s a very popular system, with stations throughout the city and some suburbs. Interestingly, the Divvy folks also make their ride data available as part of Chicago’s open data portal; Divvy’s data is available here. The goal in this assignment is to input ride data for a period of time, and perform some analysis of the data: # of bikes, which stations are in use the most often, the average ride duration, etc.
